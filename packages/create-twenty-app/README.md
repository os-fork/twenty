Create Twenty App is the official scaffolding CLI for building apps on top of [Twenty CRM](https://twenty.com). It sets up a ready‑to‑run project that works seamlessly with the [twenty-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twenty-sdk).

- Zero‑config project bootstrap
- Preconfigured scripts for auth, dev mode (watch & sync), uninstall, and function management
- Strong TypeScript support and typed client generation

## Documentation
See Twenty application documentation https://docs.twenty.com/developers/extend/capabilities/apps

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 24+ (recommended) and Yarn 4
- A Twenty workspace and an API key (create one at https://app.twenty.com/settings/api-webhooks)

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-twenty-app@latest my-twenty-app
cd my-twenty-app

# If you don't use yarn@4
corepack enable
yarn install

# Get help and list all available commands
yarn twenty help

# Authenticate using your API key (you'll be prompted)
yarn twenty auth:login

# Add a new entity to your application (guided)
yarn twenty entity:add

# Start dev mode: watches, builds, and syncs local changes to your workspace
# (also auto-generates a typed API client in node_modules/twenty-sdk/generated)
yarn twenty app:dev

# Watch your application's function logs
yarn twenty function:logs

# Execute a function with a JSON payload
yarn twenty function:execute -n my-function -p '{"key": "value"}'

# Uninstall the application from the current workspace
yarn twenty app:uninstall
```

## What gets scaffolded
- A minimal app structure ready for Twenty with example files:
  - `application-config.ts` - Application metadata configuration
  - `roles/default-role.ts` - Default role for logic functions
  - `logic-functions/hello-world.ts` - Example logic function with HTTP trigger
  - `front-components/hello-world.tsx` - Example front component
- TypeScript configuration
- A prewired `twenty` script that delegates to the `twenty` CLI from twenty-sdk

## Next steps
- Run `yarn twenty help` to see all available commands.
- Use `yarn twenty auth:login` to authenticate with your Twenty workspace.
- Explore the generated project and add your first entity with `yarn twenty entity:add` (logic functions, front components, objects, roles).
- Use `yarn twenty app:dev` while you iterate — it watches, builds, and syncs changes to your workspace in real time.
- Types are auto‑generated by `yarn twenty app:dev` and stored in `node_modules/twenty-sdk/generated`.


## Publish your application
Applications are currently stored in `twenty/packages/twenty-apps`.

You can share your application with all Twenty users:

```bash
# pull the Twenty project
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
cd twenty

# create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-app
```

- Copy your app folder into `twenty/packages/twenty-apps`.
- Commit your changes and open a pull request on https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty

```bash
git commit -m "Add new application"
git push
```

Our team reviews contributions for quality, security, and reusability before merging.

## Troubleshooting
- Auth prompts not appearing: run `yarn twenty auth:login` again and verify the API key permissions.
- Types not generated: ensure `yarn twenty app:dev` is running — it auto‑generates the typed client.
